# PyCitySchools Analysis

Some insights into the exploratory analysis from the csv files of school_complete and student_complete within the resources folder. There are some things that can be said about the data when the datasets were merged into one to get more information about how schools were performing individually and agaisnt each other regarding their grades and other key metrics within the dataset.

Looking at the grades metrics from the dataset some things can be made about how each schools performs lower in terms of overall passing percentage with a higher budget budget compared to lower budget schools. 

Another insight is that smaller school sizes(<2000) also have better performances compared to their higher(>2000) school size rivals as this is also where the school budget for each school is also a factor as higher student population correlates to higher budget for each school.
